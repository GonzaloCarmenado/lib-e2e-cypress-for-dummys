# üöÄ lib-e2e-cypress-for-dummys

## üßê What does it do?

- üé• Records user interactions (clicks, inputs, selects...) and converts them into Cypress commands (`cy.get(...).click()`, `cy.get(...).type()`, etc.).
- üåê Automatically generates commands to intercept and wait for HTTP requests using Cypress (`cy.intercept`, `cy.wait`).
- üü¢ Start and stop recording from a floating button or with keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+R`, `Ctrl+1`, `Ctrl+2`, `Ctrl+3`).
- üìã Export generated commands to paste directly into your Cypress tests.
- üíæ Save and manage your recorded tests in a local IndexedDB database, accessible from the interface.
- üóÇÔ∏è View, copy, delete, and organize your saved tests from an advanced visual editor.
- üì¶ Import and export all your tests and interceptors in JSON format from the configuration panel.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Visual configuration panel: select language, manage the database, enable advanced options, and perform migrations.
- üß© Support for Cypress interceptors associated with each test.
- üß† Generates robust selectors: prioritizes `[data-cy]` and filters auto-generated IDs from frameworks.
- üåç Multi-language support: English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German. Selectable from the interface.
- üîí Robust persistence: your tests and settings are kept even if you close the browser.
- üõ†Ô∏è Advanced HTTP command configuration: enable automatic validations for GET/POST/PUT objects.
- üëÄ Quick preview and copy of commands and interceptors from the interface.

## ‚ö° Installation

1. Install the library in your Angular project:

```bash
npm install lib-e2e-cypress-for-dummys
```

> **Note:** Required dependencies like `ngx-indexed-db` will be installed automatically if you don‚Äôt already have them, as they are listed in the library‚Äôs `peerDependencies`.  
> Just make sure you have `@angular/core` and `@angular/common` version **18.0.0 or higher**.
> You also need to install the **primeng** library in the version suitable for your Angular version.

---

## üö¶ Basic Usage

### 1. **Configure IndexedDB**

In your configuration file (e.g., `app.config.ts` or main module):

```typescript
import { NgxIndexedDBModule } from 'ngx-indexed-db';
import { dataBaseConfiguration } from 'lib-e2e-cypress-for-dummys';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgxIndexedDBModule.forRoot(dataBaseConfiguration),
    // ...other imports
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### 2. **Import the main component into your module or standalone component:**

```typescript
import { LibE2eRecorderComponent } from 'lib-e2e-cypress-for-dummys';
```

### 3. **Add the component in your main template (e.g., in `app.component.html`):**

```html
<lib-e2e-recorder></lib-e2e-recorder>
```

### 4. **Tag elements you want easily selectable by Cypress with the `data-cy` attribute:**

```html
<input data-cy="email-input" type="email" />
<button data-cy="login-button">Login</button>
```

### 5. **(Optional) If you want to record HTTP calls/interceptors as well, add the interceptor to your app config**

```typescript
import { provideHttpClient, withInterceptors } from '@angular/common/http';
import { CypressHttpInterceptor } from 'lib-e2e-cypress-for-dummys';

export const appConfig = {
  providers: [
    // ...other providers...
    provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([CypressHttpInterceptor])),
  ],
};
```

### 6. **Done! Use the interface:**

- Click the floating ‚ñ∂Ô∏è "Record" button or use `Ctrl+R` to start recording. Interact with the app, then press ‚èπÔ∏è "Stop".
- Click üìã or `Ctrl+2` to preview generated commands.
- Click üóÇÔ∏è or `Ctrl+1` to open the visual test editor (expand, copy, delete, and view associated interceptors).
- Click ‚öôÔ∏è or `Ctrl+3` to open the configuration panel (language, export/import, advanced options).

---

## üß© Advanced Features

- **Multi-language support:** Change the interface language between English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German from the configuration panel.
- **Bulk export/import:** Export all your tests and interceptors to a JSON file and import them into another project or team.
- **Advanced HTTP configuration:** Enable automatic validations for objects in GET/POST/PUT commands.
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** Control recording and open panels quickly (`Ctrl+R`, `Ctrl+1`, `Ctrl+2`, `Ctrl+3`).
- **Visual test editor:** View, copy, delete, and organize your saved tests. Expand each test to see commands and associated interceptors.
- **Quick preview and copy:** Copy Cypress commands or only interceptors to the clipboard with one click.
- **Robust persistence:** All data is stored in IndexedDB and remains even if you close the browser.
- **Smart selector:** Prioritizes `[data-cy]` and filters out auto-generated IDs for robust selectors.
- **DB migration ready:** The database structure is prepared for future migrations and expansions.

## üí° Example of Generated Commands

```js
it('User login', () => {
  cy.viewport(1900, 1200)
  cy.visit('/login')
  cy.get('[data-cy="email-input"]').clear().type('user@domain.com')
  cy.get('[data-cy="password-input"]').clear().type('123456')
  cy.get('[data-cy="login-button"]').click()
  cy.intercept('POST', '**/api/v1/login/**', (req) => {
    if (req.url.includes('login')) {
      req.alias = 'api-v1-login';
    }
  });
  cy.wait('@api-v1-login').then((interception) => { })
});
```

---

## üëç Recommendations

- Always use the `data-cy` attribute on elements you want to test for robust selectors.
- Generated commands appear in the browser console after stopping the recording and also in the preview interface.
- You can clear the command list by calling `clearCommands()` from the service if needed.
- Tests saved in IndexedDB are persistent: they won‚Äôt be deleted when you close the browser or restart the computer (unless manually cleared or using incognito mode).
- To migrate or share your tests across projects, use the export/import functionality from the configuration panel.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Only supports Angular **18+**.
- Commands are generated in the console and UI, not as physical files.
- Does not cover all possible events or custom components.
- If you change the DB structure, make sure to update the version in the configuration to avoid migration errors.
